## How to start

For `npm` user
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

For `yarn` user

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Test

> I wrote 1 test only. Coz I don't have enough time to setup enzyme in `create-react-app`. I have experience setup whole environment, but not in `create-react-app`. So there does not have any test for react component.

For `npm` user
```bash
npm run test
```

For `yarn` user
```bash
yarn test
```

## Setup
- create-react-app
- react
- foundation css

## Through
Within limit of time, I think delivery value to end users is more important. So at the end I sacrifice the quality of the software.

Regarding Google API key, I don't know I need to fill my credit card number to get a key. I think the test can be better, if the API key is provided.

## Performance
The application performance is really bad, the whole list always do some unnecessary re-render. I'd like to improve it if I have time.

## Learn
- I'd like to learn how to customize `create-react-app`
- I should learn a react UI component library. But in production project, I still wanna insist using self-build component.
